# PPG-Image-Classifier
For the paper: An Interpretable Machine Vision Approach to Human Activity Recognition using Photoplethysmograph Sensor Data

The Retrain_Transfer_Learning notebook is for retraining the image classifier. You must edit your own directories prior to using [1]. 

Nested_Cross-Validation is used for the CNN-SVM section of the paper. It uses the extracted features from the retrained Inception network to train a support vector classifier over which the paramaters can be optimised. You may choose the values to optimse over. This is based on the scikit learn Nested Cross-Validation example [2].
